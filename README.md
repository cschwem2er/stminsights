## A Shiny Application for Structural Topic Models

This app enables interactive validation, interpretation and
visualization of [Structural Topic
Models](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/) (STM). Stminsights is
focused on making your life easier after fitting your STM models. In
case you are not familiar with the STM
[package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stm), the corresponding
vignette is an excellent starting point.

## How to Install

You can download and install the latest development version of
stminsights by running
`devtools::install_github('cschwem2er/stminsights')`.

For Windows users installing from github requires proper setup of
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

stminsights can also be installed from CRAN by running
`install.packages('stminsights')`.

## How to Use

After loading stminsights you can launch the shiny app in your browser:

``` r
library(stminsights)
run_stminsights()
```

You can then upload a `.RData` file which should include:

  - one or several `stm` objects.
  - one or several `estimateEffect` objects.
  - an object `out` which was used to fit your stm models.

As an example, the following code fits two models and estimates effects
for the Political Blog Corpus. Afterwards, all objects required for
stminsights are stored in `stm_poliblog5k.RData`.

``` r
library(stm)

out <- list(documents = poliblog5k.docs,
            vocab = poliblog5k.voc,
            meta = poliblog5k.meta)

poli <- stm(documents = out$documents, 
            vocab = out$vocab,
            data = out$meta, 
            prevalence = ~ rating * s(day),
            K = 20)
prep_poli <- estimateEffect(1:20 ~ rating * s(day), poli,
                            meta = out$meta)

poli_content <-  stm(documents = out$documents, 
                     vocab = out$vocab,
                     data = out$meta, 
                     prevalence = ~ rating + s(day),
                     content = ~ rating,
                     K = 15)  
prep_poli_content <- estimateEffect(1:15 ~ rating + s(day), poli_content,
                                    meta = out$meta)

save.image('stm_poliblog5k.RData')
```

After launching stminsights and uploading the file, all objects are
automatically imported and you can select which models and effect
estimates to analyze.

In addition to the shiny app, several helper functions are available,
e.g.Â `get_effects()` for storing effect estimates in a tidy dataframe.

## How to Deploy on Shiny Server

To deploy stminsights to your own shiny server, place the file `app.R`,
which is located at `inst/app` of this package, to a folder in your
server directory and you should be good to go.
